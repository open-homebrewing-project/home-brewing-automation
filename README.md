Open Source Home Brewing Automation Project
=======================

The goal of this project is to define plans for an completely automated home brewing system.

This project draws inspiration from other DYI OpenSource projects such as...

- [Open Compute Project](http://www.opencompute.org/)
- [Open Window Framing](https://github.com/luke0x/open-window-farming)
- [OpenSource Ecology](https://github.com/OSE)
- [Bartendro](https://github.com/partyrobotics/bartendro)

## What is Open Source Home Brewing Automation?

Home brewing is fun, but it's alot of work. My brew sessions are between 4 to 8 hours includeing clean up. A good amount of that time is spend just waiting for your wort to hit the right tempature or just waiting for things to cool down. Woudn't it be nice to automate some of these processess, or how about all of them?

## The Ultimate Goal

The grand vision is a completely automated how brewing setup. Just add grains, hops, and yeast, wait for a couple of weeks and you have beer. The features of grand vision system.

1. Precise control of tempature throughout the process.
1. Automated cleaning cycle.
1. Built from off the shelf parts when possible
1. Near realtime measurement of key parameters (temp, gravity) throughout the fermentation process.
1. From grains, hops, and yeast to beer (all you need to care about is adding the grains, hope, and yeast. Everthing else is automated until the beer is feremented and read to keg or bottle.
1. Granular control of fermentation tempature throughout the fermentation process.
1. Closed loop as possible to reduce chance of contamination. 

## The High Level Break Down Of The Brewing Process

1. Bring strike temp water up to temp.
2. Add grains and mash out for time.
3. Sparge grains for time.
4. Bring wort to boil and boil for time.
5. While boiling add hops at defined schedule.
6. Cool wort down.
7. Move to fermenation tank.
8. Add yeast.
9. Wait...
10. Move to secondary fermenation tank.
11. Add other flavoring.
12. Wait...
13. Move to bottles or keg.
